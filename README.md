Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection using PCA and Logistic Regression

Purpose:

This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression for classification in the context of credit card fraud detection.

Dataset:

Credit Card Fraud Dataset: A dataset containing credit card transaction data, including features like transaction time, amount, and various other attributes.The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the credit card fraud dataset.
Separate the features and target variable.
Standardize the features to ensure they have a similar scale.
PCA Application:

Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Determine the optimal number of principal components based on the explained variance.
Transform the data using the selected principal components.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model on the training set using the PCA-transformed features.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
New Data Prediction (Optional):

Use the trained model to predict the class labels for new, unseen data points.
Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.preprocessing
sklearn.decomposition
sklearn.model_selection
sklearn.linear_model
sklearn.metrics

Usage:
Replace "your_dataset.csv" with the actual path to your credit card fraud dataset.
Run the Python script.
The code will output the optimal number of principal components, model evaluation metrics, and predictions for new data (if provided).

Customization:
You can experiment with different classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and hyperparameters.
Adjust the explained variance threshold for PCA to control the level of dimensionality reduction.
Modify the new data points for prediction to test the model's performance on various scenarios.

Additional Notes:
Ensure the dataset has the appropriate features and target variable.
Consider handling class imbalance if the dataset is skewed.
Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set before deploying it in production.
